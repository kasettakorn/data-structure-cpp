# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++. Each data structure is implemented in a separate header file and can be easily included in your projects.

## Available Data Structures

- **LinkedList**: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack using an array.
- **Queue**: Implementation of a queue using a circular array.
- **BinarySearchTree**: Implementation of a binary search tree.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kasettakorn/data-structure-cpp.git

arduino
Copy code

2. Include the desired header file in your C++ project:

```cpp
#include "LinkedList.h"
#include "Stack.h"
#include "Queue.h"
#include "BinarySearchTree.h"
#include "Heap.h"


```
3. Use the data structures in your code.
